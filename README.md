# 3D Holographic Solar System Simulator

Welcome to the **3D Holographic Solar System Simulator**! This project is a cool experiment in visualizing our solar system in 3D using modern web technologies. If you're into space, physics, or just love some out-of-this-world visuals, you're in the right place.

## Overview

This simulator leverages **Three.js** for rendering a dynamic, interactive 3D scene, **Chart.js** for real-time data visualization, and a custom physics engine to simulate the gravitational interactions of celestial bodies. You'll see planets, moons, and even custom orbits come alive in a holographic style.

> Personally, I think nothing beats seeing the cosmos dance right on your browser. Itâ€™s a fun mix of art and science!

## Features

- **3D Visualization:** Explore a stunning 3D simulation of our solar system with realistic orbital mechanics.
- **Interactive HUD:** Keep track of simulation time, energy, momentum, and other key metrics.
- **Custom Orbits:** Easily add your own celestial bodies and define custom orbits.
- **Real-Time Charts:** Watch data evolve in real time with integrated Chart.js graphs.
- **Multiple Integrators:** Toggle between RK4 and Leapfrog integration methods for different simulation experiences.
- **Responsive Controls:** Adjust time scale, reset the simulation, and export simulation data with a single click.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended)
- A local server environment (optional, but recommended for full functionality)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-holographic-solar-system-simulator.git
